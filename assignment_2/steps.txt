Steps to run get_metadata_from_inside.sh are pretty simple. For this, you have to be logged in to the AWS server for which you want to check meta data.
./get_metadata_from_inside.sh ami-id

Only below mentioned things can be passed to check.
ami-id
ami-launch-index
ami-manifest-path
block-device-mapping/
events/
hostname
iam/
instance-action
instance-id
instance-type
local-hostname
local-ipv4
mac
metrics/
network/
placement/
profile
public-hostname
public-ipv4
public-keys/
reservation-id
security-groups
services/



----------------------------------------------------

While i was creating the second script (get_metadata_from_outside.sh), I realized that getting the meta data of the server when you are not logged in to the aws instance
is quite some work. So this script is incomplete, but will take some time to complete and cant be completed in 30 mins. The main thing to take care is how you can get the data that was produced by the curl command to your local machine.

./get_metadata_from_outside.sh -u ec2-user -k key.pem -i 1.2.3.4 -d ami-id

--------------------------------------------

There is another option that we can use and that will be installing aws cli on your machine, but you cant get the entire meta data
of your aws machine using that. Possible things that we can get are
Possible values:

instanceType
kernel
ramdisk
userData
disableApiTermination
instanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior
rootDeviceName
blockDeviceMapping
productCodes
sourceDestCheck
groupSet
ebsOptimized
sriovNetSupport
enaSupport

For e.g aws ec2 describe-instance-attribute --instance-id i-123jhjh88 --attribute instanceType
