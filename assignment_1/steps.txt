In the starting, i didnt understand this questions clearly and then asked Reta to provide more description about it. But she also
didnt have any more details. Then i answere it based on whatever i understood.

In this assignment, I tried to create the resource group and VNET on three differnet environments using the same piece of code using Terraform.
You need to run the jenkins build by passing the location and subscription. It will fetch the details for that environment from the 
environment.tfvars file.

So using this setup, you can setup three differnet environments using the same code base. You just need to pass different value while running
the jenkins build.
