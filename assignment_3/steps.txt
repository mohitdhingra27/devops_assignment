There is a script val.sh and the abc.json (test json file) with nested entries in it.
To run the script, you need to run it like mentioned below:
  ./val.sh abc.json address/home_addres/old_address
  
  It should most probably work on your system. For me, it worked on my Mac but didnt run on Linux. I think my linux system has some shell related issue
  In case, it doesnt work on your system.
  
  You can declare three variables like below and then run the command.
  
  parm1=address
  parm2=home_address
  parm3=old_address
  
  jq --arg v1 "$parm1" --arg v2 "$parm2" --arg v3 "$parm3" '.[$v1] | .[$v2] | .[$v3]' abc.json
  
  This will give you the required output.
